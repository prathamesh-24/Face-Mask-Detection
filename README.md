# Face Mask Detection App

A machine learning-based application for detecting face masks in real-time using **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, **MobileNetV2**, and **OpenCV**. This project demonstrates the potential for real-world applications, including public safety measures during pandemics.

## Features
- Real-time face mask detection using live video feed.
- Computationally efficient model leveraging **MobileNetV2** architecture for deployment on embedded systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
- Accurate detection without using morphed masked images datasets.
- Potential for integration with CCTV systems in public spaces like airports, offices, schools, and railway stations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Keras** and **TensorFlow** for deep learning  
- **MobileNetV2** architecture  
- **OpenCV** for real-time video processing  

## Applications
- Public safety enforcement during Covid-19 outbreaks.
- Embedded system integration for surveillance systems in high-density areas.  
- Ensures compliance with face mask protocols in public and private spaces.

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies:
